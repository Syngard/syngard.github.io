BreizhCTF is an event held in Rennes every year around the months of March-April. This year marked the third time I participated in the event, two years after the last one was held because of the pandemic. T

## Reverse Engineering

There were six reversing challenges in the CTF, of which I managed to solve four. The last challenge wasn't flagged by any team during the event. I'll try to post a writeup if I manage to solve it later.

### Challenge 1

### Challenge 2

### Challenge 3

### Challenge 4

This challenge was published during the night in a new "Android" category but it was still kind of a reversing challenge.
